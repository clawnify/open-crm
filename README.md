# OpenClaw CRM App: The Open-Source HubSpot Alternative for SaaS

A lightweight CRM with contacts, companies, and deals — built for SaaS dashboards and AI agents. Part of the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) ecosystem. Zero cloud dependencies — runs locally with SQLite.

Built with **React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui** on **Hono + Cloudflare D1**. Path-based routing, UUID keys, a dark mode that follows the OS, and a dual-mode UI: one for humans and one for AI agents (larger targets, always-visible actions).

## What Is It?

Clawnify CRM App is a production-ready contact relationship manager designed for the OpenClaw community. Think of it as an open-source HubSpot alternative — a CRM you can self-host, customize, and embed in any SaaS product.

Unlike HubSpot or Salesforce, this runs entirely on your own infrastructure with no API keys, no vendor lock-in, and no per-seat pricing. It provides a complete sales pipeline and lead management system. Manage contacts, companies, and deals with rich column types, inline editing, and full CRUD — all out of the box.

## Features

- **Three entities** — contacts, companies, and deals with foreign-key relationships (UUID keys, not enumerable ids)
- **Activity timeline** — every contact/company/deal has a feed; emails, meetings, notes, and deal-won events all log to it
- **Integrations (Clawnify connections)** — email a contact via Gmail, schedule a Google Calendar meeting, and post to Slack when a deal is won — all through the org's Clawnify connections, no keys in the app
- **CSV / XLSX import** — upload a spreadsheet, map columns to fields (exact-match auto-mapping), preview, import; company names resolve to existing companies or are created
- **Deal pipeline** — a board tracking deals through stages (prospect → qualified → proposal → negotiation → won/lost) with per-column totals
- **Path routing** — deep-linkable views and records (`/contacts/:id`)
- **Rich cells** — avatars, category badges, company favicons, tabular currency, email/phone links
- **Sorting, search, pagination** — server-side, debounced
- **Dual-mode UI** — human-optimized + AI-agent-optimized (`?agent=true`); dark mode follows the OS

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clawnify/open-crm.git
cd open-crm
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5175` in your browser. Data persists in `data.db`.

### Agent Mode (for OpenClaw / Browser-Use)

Append `?agent=true` to the URL:

```
http://localhost:5175/?agent=true
```

This activates an agent-friendly UI with:
- Explicit "Edit" / "Delete" buttons on every row (no hover-to-reveal)
- Larger click targets for reliable browser automation
- Always-visible action buttons
- Semantic labels on all interactive elements

The human UI stays unchanged — hover-to-reveal actions, compact spacing, and a clean interface.

### Data Model

Three entities with foreign key relationships:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    companies ||--o{ contacts : "has"
    contacts  ||--o{ deals    : "has"

    companies {
        text id PK
        text name
        text domain
        text industry
        text phone
        text email
        text notes
        text created_at
        text updated_at
    }
    contacts {
        text id PK
        text first_name
        text last_name
        text email
        text phone
        text company_id FK "→ companies · ON DELETE SET NULL"
        text title
        text status
        text created_at
        text updated_at
    }
    deals {
        text id PK
        text name
        text contact_id FK "→ contacts · ON DELETE SET NULL"
        real value
        text stage
        text close_date
        text notes
        text created_at
        text updated_at
    }
```

```sql
companies (id, name, domain, industry, phone, email, notes)
contacts  (id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, company_id → companies, title, status)
deals     (id, name, contact_id → contacts, value, stage, close_date, notes)
```

Contacts belong to companies. Deals belong to contacts (and inherit the company). Deleting a company sets `company_id` to NULL on its contacts. Deleting a contact sets `contact_id` to NULL on its deals.
