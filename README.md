# OpenClaw CRM App: The Open-Source HubSpot Alternative for SaaS

A lightweight CRM with contacts, companies, and deals — built for SaaS dashboards and AI agents. Part of the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) ecosystem. Zero cloud dependencies — runs locally with SQLite.

Built with **Preact + Hono + SQLite**. Ships with a dual-mode UI: one for humans (clean, responsive tables) and one for AI agents (explicit buttons, large targets).

## What Is It?

Clawnify CRM App is a production-ready contact relationship manager designed for the OpenClaw community. Think of it as an open-source HubSpot alternative — a CRM you can self-host, customize, and embed in any SaaS product.

Unlike HubSpot or Salesforce, this runs entirely on your own infrastructure with no API keys, no vendor lock-in, and no per-seat pricing. It provides a complete sales pipeline and lead management system. Manage contacts, companies, and deals with rich column types, inline editing, and full CRUD — all out of the box.

## Features

- **Three entities** — contacts, companies, and deals with foreign key relationships
- **Rich column types** — avatars, colored pills, entity icons with favicons, currency formatting, email/phone links
- **Sidebar navigation** — switch between entities with count badges
- **Sorting & filtering** — per-column sorting with debounced search
- **Pagination** — server-side with page controls
- **Deal pipeline** — track deals through stages (prospect → qualified → proposal → negotiation → won/lost)
- **Footer calculations** — deal count and total value sum
- **Company favicons** — auto-fetched from domain via [Favicone](https://favicone.com)
- **Dual-mode UI** — human-optimized + AI-agent-optimized (`?agent=true`)
- **SQLite persistence** — auto-creates schema and seeds realistic sample data on first run

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clawnify/crm-app.git
cd crm-app
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5175` in your browser. Data persists in `data.db`.

### Agent Mode (for OpenClaw / Browser-Use)

Append `?agent=true` to the URL:

```
http://localhost:5175/?agent=true
```

This activates an agent-friendly UI with:
- Explicit "Edit" / "Delete" buttons on every row (no hover-to-reveal)
- Larger click targets for reliable browser automation
- Always-visible action buttons
- Semantic labels on all interactive elements

The human UI stays unchanged — hover-to-reveal actions, compact spacing, and a clean interface.

### Data Model

Three entities with foreign key relationships:

```
┌──────────────┐       ┌──────────────┐       ┌──────────────┐
│  companies   │       │   contacts   │       │    deals     │
├──────────────┤       ├──────────────┤       ├──────────────┤
│ id           │◄──┐   │ id           │◄──┐   │ id           │
│ name         │   │   │ first_name   │   │   │ name         │
│ domain       │   │   │ last_name    │   │   │ contact_id ──┼───┘
│ industry     │   │   │ email        │   │   │ value        │
│ phone        │   └───┼─ company_id  │   │   │ stage        │
│ email        │       │ phone        │   │   │ close_date   │
│ notes        │       │ title        │   │   │ notes        │
│ created_at   │       │ status       │   │   │ created_at   │
│ updated_at   │       │ created_at   │   │   │ updated_at   │
└──────────────┘       │ updated_at   │   │   └──────────────┘
                       └──────────────┘   │
                                          │
                    ON DELETE SET NULL ────┘
```

```sql
companies (id, name, domain, industry, phone, email, notes)
contacts  (id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, company_id → companies, title, status)
deals     (id, name, contact_id → contacts, value, stage, close_date, notes)
```

Contacts belong to companies. Deals belong to contacts (and inherit the company). Deleting a company sets `company_id` to NULL on its contacts. Deleting a contact sets `contact_id` to NULL on its deals.
